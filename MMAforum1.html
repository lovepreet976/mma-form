<h2><p>Mixed martial arts</p></h2>
<h3><p>Mixed martial arts (MMA), sometimes referred to as cage fighting,no holds barred (NHB), and ultimate fighting,
is a full-contact combat sport based on striking, grappling and ground fighting, incorporating techniques from various
 combat sports from around the world. The first documented use of the term mixed martial arts was in a review of
 UFC 1 by television critic Howard Rosenberg in 1993. The question of who actually coined the term is subject to debate.
During the early 20th century, various interstylistic contests took place throughout Japan and in the countries of 
the Four Asian Tigers. In Brazil, there was the sport of Vale Tudo, in which fighters from various styles fought with
 little to no rules. The Gracie family was known to promote Vale Tudo matches as a way to promote their own Brazilian 
jiu-jitsu style. A precursor to modern MMA was the 1976 Ali vs. Inoki exhibition bout (which ended in a draw after 15 rounds),
 fought between boxer Muhammad Ali and wrestler Antonio Inoki in Japan, where it later inspired the foundation of 
Pancrase in 1993 and the Pride Fighting Championships in 1997.

In 1980, CV Productions, Inc. created the first regulated MMA league in the United States, called Tough Guy Contest,
 which was later renamed Battle of the Superfighters. The company sanctioned ten tournaments in Pennsylvania. However,
 in 1983 the Pennsylvania State Senate passed a bill prohibiting the sport. In the 1990s, the Gracie family brought their
 Brazilian jiu-jitsu style, first developed in Brazil from the 1920s, to the United States – which culminated in the founding 
of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) promotion company in 1993. The company held an event with almost no rules, mostly
 due to the influence of Art Davie and Rorion Gracie attempting to replicate Vale Tudo fights that existed in Brazil and would
 later implement a different set of rules (example: eliminating kicking a grounded opponent), which differed from other leagues
 which were more in favour of realistic, street like fights.
Originally promoted as a competition to find the most effective martial arts for real unarmed combat,
 competitors from different fighting styles were pitted against one another in contests with relatively few rules.
 Later, individual fighters incorporated multiple martial arts into their style. MMA promoters were pressured to adopt additional 
rules to increase competitors' safety, to comply with sport regulations and to broaden mainstream acceptance of the sport.
Following these changes, the sport has seen increased popularity with a pay-per-view business that rivals boxing and professional wrestling.</p></h3>
<h2><p>Early history:</p></h2>
<h4><p>Antiquity</p></h4>
<h3><p>In Ancient China, combat sport appeared in the form of Leitai, a no-holds-barred mixed combat sport that combined Chinese martial arts,
 boxing and wrestling.
The Pancrastinae: A statue portraying the pancratium, an event which took place in the Roman Colosseum. Even as late as the Early Middle Ages,
 statues were put up in Rome and other cities to honor remarkable pankratiasts. This statue, now part of the Uffizi collection, is a Roman copy
 of a lost Greek original, circa 3rd century BC.

A scene of Ancient Greek pankratiasts fighting. Originally found on a Panathenaic amphora, Lamberg Collection.
In Ancient Greece, there was a sport called pankration, which featured grappling and striking skills similar to those found in modern MMA. 
Pankration was formed by combining the already established wrestling and boxing traditions and, in Olympic terms, first featured in the 33rd Olympiad
 in 648 BC. All strikes and holds were allowed with the exception of biting and gouging, which were banned. The fighters, called pankratiasts, 
fought until someone could not continue or signaled submission by raising their index finger; there were no rounds.According to the historian 
E. Norman Gardiner, "No branch of athletics was more popular than the pankration." There is also evidence of similar mixed combat sports in Ancient Egypt,
India and Japan.</p></h3>
<h4><p>Modern-era precursors</p></h4>
<h3><p>The mid-19th century saw the prominence of the new sport savate in the combat sports circle. French savate fighters wanted to test their techniques 
against the traditional combat styles of its time. In 1852, a contest was held in France between French savateurs and English bare-knuckle boxers in which
 French fighter Rambaud alias la Resistance fought English fighter Dickinson and won using his kicks. However, the English team still won the four other
 match-ups during the contest. Contests occurred in the late 19th to mid-20th century between French Savateurs and other combat styles. Examples include
 a 1905 fight between French savateur George Dubois and a judo practitioner Re-nierand which resulted in the latter winning by submission, as well as the
 highly publicized 1957 fight between French savateur and professional boxer Jacques Cayron and a young Japanese karateka named Mochizuki Hiroo which ended
 when Cayron knocked Hiroo out with a hook.

Catch wrestling appeared in the late 19th century, combining several global styles of wrestling, including Indian pehlwani and English wrestling.
 In turn, catch wrestling went on to greatly influence modern MMA.No-holds-barred fighting reportedly took place in the late 1880s when wrestlers
 representing the style of catch wrestling and many others met in tournaments and music-hall challenge matches throughout Europe. In the US, the first
 major encounter between a boxer and a wrestler in modern times took place in 1887 when John L. Sullivan, then heavyweight world boxing champion, entered 
the ring with his trainer, wrestling champion William Muldoon, and was slammed to the mat in two minutes. The next publicized encounter occurred in the 
late 1890s when future heavyweight boxing champion Bob Fitzsimmons took on European wrestling champion Ernest Roeber. In September 1901, Frank "Paddy" 
Slavin, who had been a contender for Sullivan's boxing title, knocked out future world wrestling champion Frank Gotch in Dawson City, Canada. The 
judo-practitioner Ren-nierand, who gained fame after defeating George Dubois, would fight again in another similar contest, which he lost to Ukrainian 
Catch wrestler Ivan Poddubny.

Another early example of mixed martial arts was Bartitsu, which Edward William Barton-Wright founded in London in 1899. Combining catch wrestling, judo,
 boxing, savate, jujutsu and canne de combat (French stick fighting), Bartitsu was the first martial art known to have combined Asian and European fighting
 styles, and which saw MMA-style contests throughout England, pitting European Catch wrestlers and Japanese Judoka champions against representatives of 
various European wrestling styles.

Among the precursors, but not ancestors, of modern MMA are mixed style contests throughout Europe, Japan, and the Pacific Rim during the early 1900s.
 In Japan, these contests were known as merikan, from the Japanese slang for "American [fighting]". Merikan contests were fought under a variety of rules,
 including points decision, best of three throws or knockdowns, and victory via knockout or submission.

Sambo, a martial art and combat sport developed in Russia in the early 1920s, merged various forms of combat styles such as wrestling, judo and striking
 into one unique martial art. The popularity of professional wrestling, which was contested under various catch wrestling rules at the time, waned after
 World War I, when the sport split into two genres: "shoot", in which the fighters actually competed, and "show", which evolved into modern professional
 wrestling. In 1936, heavyweight boxing contender Kingfish Levinsky and professional wrestler Ray Steele competed in a mixed match, which catch wrestler
 Steele won in 35 seconds. 27 years later, Ray Steele's protégé Lou Thesz fought boxer Jersey Joe Walcott twice in mixed style bouts. The first match
 was a real contest which Thesz won while the second match was a work, which Thesz also won.

In the 1940s in the Palama Settlement in Hawaii, 5 martial arts masters, under the leadership of Adriano Emperado, curious to determine which martial 
art was best, began testing each other in their respective arts of Kenpo, Jujitsu, Chinese and American boxing and Tang soo do. From this they
 developed Kajukenbo, the first American Mixed Martial Arts.


Masahiko Kimura vs. Hélio Gracie, a 1951 bout between Japanese judo fighter Masahiko Kimura and Brazilian jiu jitsu founder Hélio Gracie in Brazil, 
was an early high-profile mixed martial arts bout.
In 1951, a high-profile grappling match was Masahiko Kimura vs. Hélio Gracie, which was wrestled between judoka Masahiko Kimura and Brazilian jiu jitsu 
founder Hélio Gracie in Brazil. Kimura defeated Gracie using a gyaku-ude-garami armlock, which later became known as the "Kimura" in Brazilian jiu jitsu.
 In 1963, a catch wrestler and judoka "Judo" Gene Lebell fought professional boxer Milo Savage in a no-holds-barred match. Lebell won by Harai Goshi to 
rear naked choke, leaving Savage unconscious. This was the first televised bout of mixed-style fighting in North America. The hometown crowd was so
 enraged that they began to boo and throw chairs at Lebell.

On February 12, 1963, three karatekas from Oyama dojo (kyokushin later) went to the Lumpinee Boxing Stadium in Thailand and fought against three 
Muay Thai fighters. The three kyokushin karate fighters were Tadashi Nakamura, Kenji Kurosaki and Akio Fujihira (also known as Noboru Osawa), while 
the Muay Thai team of three had only one authentic Thai fighter.Japan won 2–1: Tadashi Nakamura and Akio Fujihira both knocked out their opponents 
with punches while Kenji Kurosaki, who fought the Thai, was knocked out by elbows. The Japanese fighter who lost, Kenji Kurosaki, was a kyokushin 
instructor, rather than a contender, and that he had stood in as a substitute for the absent chosen fighter. In June of the same year, karateka 
and future kickboxer Tadashi Sawamura faced top Thai fighter Samarn Sor Adisorn: Sawamura was knocked down sixteen times on his way to defeat.
 Sawamura went on to incorporate what he learned in that fight in kickboxing tournaments.


Bruce Lee popularized the concept of mixed martial arts via his hybrid system of Jeet Kune Do during the late 1960s to early 1970s.
During the late 1960s to early 1970s, the concept of combining the elements of multiple martial arts was popularized in the West by Bruce Lee via his
 system of Jeet Kune Do. Lee believed that "the best fighter is not a Boxer, Karate or Judo man. The best fighter is someone who can adapt to any style,
 to be formless, to adopt an individual's own style and not following the system of styles." In 2004, UFC President Dana White would call Lee the "father
 of mixed martial arts" stating: "If you look at the way Bruce Lee trained, the way he fought, and many of the things he wrote, he said the perfect style
 was no style. You take a little something from everything. You take the good things from every different discipline, use what works, and you throw the
 rest away".

A contemporary of Bruce Lee, Wing Chun practitioner Wong Shun Leung, gained prominence fighting in 60-100 illegal beimo fights against other Chinese
 martial artists of various styles. Wong also fought and won against Western fighters of other combat styles, such as his match against a Russian boxer
 named Giko, his televised fight against a fencer, and his well-documented fight against Taiwanese Kung-Fu master Wu Ming Jeet. Wong combined boxing 
and kickboxing into his kung fu, as Bruce Lee did.


Muhammad Ali vs. Antonio Inoki, a 1976 bout in Japan where boxer Muhammad Ali fought wrestler Antonio Inoki, was an important precursor to MMA contests.
Muhammad Ali vs. Antonio Inoki took place in Japan in 1976. The classic match-up between professional boxer and professional wrestler turned sour as 
each fighter refused to engage in the other's style, and after a 15-round stalemate it was declared a draw. Muhammad Ali sustained a substantial
 amount of damage to his legs, as Antonio Inoki slide-kicked him continuously for the duration of the bout, causing him to be hospitalized for the next 
three days. The fight played an important role in the history of mixed martial arts. In Japan, several shoot-style professional wrestling 
promotions like UWF International and Pro Wrestling Fujiwara Gumi attempted to create a combat-based style which blended wrestling, kickboxing and 
submission grappling. While the matches were predetermined, the style was very convincing at the time and can be retrospectively considered a precursor 
to mixed martial arts. Professional wrestlers Masakatsu Funaki and Minoru Suzuki founded Pancrase in 1993 which promoted legitimate contests initially 
under professional wrestling rules. These promotions inspired Pride Fighting Championships which started in 1997. Pride was acquired by its rival Ultimate
 Fighting Championship in 2007.

A well-documented fight between Golden Gloves boxing champion Joey Hadley and Arkansas Karate Champion David Valovich happened on June 22, 1976, 
at Memphis Blues Baseball Park. The bout had mixed rules: the karateka was allowed to use his fists, feet and knees, while the boxer could only use
 his fists. Hadley won the fight via knockout on the first round.

In 1988 Rick Roufus challenged Changpuek Kiatsongrit to a non-title Muay Thai vs. kickboxing super fight. Rick Roufus was at the time an
 undefeated Kickboxer and held both the KICK Super Middleweight World title and the PKC Middleweight U.S title. Changpuek Kiatsongrit was finding
 it increasingly difficult to get fights in Thailand as his weight (70 kg) was not typical for Thailand, where competitive bouts tended to be at the
 lower weights. Roufus knocked Changpuek down twice with punches in the first round, breaking Changpuek's jaw, but lost by technical knockout in the
 fourth round due to the culmination of low kicks to the legs that he was unprepared for. This match was the first popular fight which showcased the 
power of such low kicks to a predominantly Western audience</p></h3>
<h2><p>Origin of the term MMA</p></h2>
<h3><p>The first documented use of the name mixed martial arts was in a review of UFC 1 by television critic Howard Rosenberg, in 1993. The term gained
 popularity when the website newfullcontact.com, then one of the biggest covering the sport, hosted and reprinted the article. The first use of the term
 by a promotion was in September 1995 by Rick Blume, president and CEO of Battlecade Extreme Fighting, just after UFC 7. UFC official Jeff Blatnick
 was responsible for the Ultimate Fighting Championship officially adopting the name mixed martial arts. It was previously marketed as "Ultimate Fighting" 
and "No Holds Barred (NHB)", until Blatnick and John McCarthy proposed the name "MMA" at the UFC 17 rules meeting in response to increased public 
criticism. The question as to who actually coined the name is still in debate.</p></h3>
<p><h2>MMA organizations:</h2>
<h4>Promotions</h4></p>
<h3><p>According to MMA portal Tapology.com listings, hundreds of MMA promotions around the world produce MMA events.
Since the UFC came to prominence in mainstream media in 2006, and with their 2007 merger with Pride FC and purchases of WEC and Strikeforce,
 no companies have presented significant competition,[65] and the UFC is regarded as having most of the top ranked talent.Fighters usually get 
contracts in the UFC after competing successfully in other MMA promotions from around the world.

Some MMA promotions tend to exist more to build up prospects while others have a mix of prospects and veterans. Some exist only to be feeder leagues
 to the bigger promotions (e.g. LFA, CWFC), others exist to try to be the best in the world (e.g. ACB, ONE Championship). Some promotions only do four
 shows a year while others are doing them monthly.

According to ScorecardMMA.com, one of the world's top statistical rankings services for MMA,and the only one currently ranking MMA promotions
 worldwide statistically; "To rank MMA Promotions we use an index that we calculate weekly- Promotion Score.Promo Score calculation is based on the
 strength of Events and Fighters that Promotion has at that time. Promo Score has three main components:

Event Index: based on the quality of events in the last quarter and in the last year.
Owned Fighter Index: calculated based on the quality of fighters that the promotion currently owns (contracted, or used recently).
Utilized Fighters Index: fighters that the promotion has used in the last four months and in the last three quarters.</p></h3>
