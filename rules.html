<h2><p> 
Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts
</p>
<h2>
<h3>
<p>
In April 2000, the California State Athletic Commission voted unanimously in favor of regulations that later became the foundation for the Unified Rules of
 Mixed Martial Arts. However, when the legislation was sent to California's capital for review, it was determined that the sport fell outside the 
jurisdiction of the CSAC, rendering the vote superfluous.

In September 2000, the New Jersey State Athletic Control Board began to allow MMA promoters to conduct events in New Jersey. The intent was to allow the 
NJSACB to observe actual events and gather information to establish a comprehensive set of rules to effectively regulate the sport.

On April 3, 2001, the NJSACB held a meeting to discuss the regulation of MMA events. This meeting attempted to unify the myriad of rules and regulations 
which have been utilized by the different MMA organizations. At this meeting, the proposed uniform rules were agreed upon by the NJSACB, several other
 regulatory bodies, numerous promoters of MMA events and other interested parties in attendance. At the conclusion of the meeting, all parties in 
attendance were able to agree upon a uniform set of rules to govern the sport of MMA.

The rules adopted by the NJSACB have become the de facto standard set of rules for professional MMA across North America. All state, provincial, &
 municipal athletic commissions that regulate MMA have assimilated these rules into their existing unarmed combat competition rules and statutes. 
For a promotion to hold MMA events in a sanctioned venue, the promotion must abide by the commission's body of rules.

On July 30, 2009, a motion was made at the annual meeting of the Association of Boxing Commissions to adopt these rules as the "Unified Rules of Mixed
 Martial Arts". The motion passed unanimously.

<h2>
<p>
Rounds
</p>
</h2>
<h3>
<p>
Every round is five minutes in duration with a one-minute rest period in-between rounds. Non-title matches must not normally exceed three rounds,
 but the governing commission can grant dispensation for non-title five round bouts, as is usually done for the Main Event in the UFC.Title matches 
can be sanctioned for five rounds.
</p>
</h3>
<h2>
<p>
Attire
</p>
</h2>
<p>
<h3>
All competitors must fight in approved shorts, without shoes or any other sort of foot padding. Shirts, gis or long pants (including gi pants) are
 not allowed. Fighters must use approved light gloves (4–6 ounces) that allow fingers to grab. A mouthguard and protective cup are also required and 
are checked by a State Athletic Committee official before being allowed to enter the cage/ring. Furthermore, approved leg and chest (in the case of women)
 protectors must be provided by the contestant.
</p>

<h2>
<p>
Judging criteria
</p>
</h2>
<h3>
<p>
The ten-point must system is used for all fights. Three judges score each round with ten points to the winner and nine points or fewer to the other
 fighter. In New Jersey, the fewest points a fighter can receive is 7. If the round is even, both fighters receive ten points. Penalty points 
(usually one point for each offence, occasionally two points) decided by the referee are deducted from each judge's score for that round for the 
offending fighter.
</p>
</h3>
<h3>
<p>
The Association of Boxing Commissions has published a guideline of what judges in the US should consider most when scoring a round. 
"Effective striking/grappling" (defined as legal strikes that inflict more damage on one fighter in that round, as well as successful takedowns,
 reversals, and submission attempts) is seen as the primary criteria, with judges also asked to take each round on its own merits rather than consider
 cumulative impact of strikes. "Effective aggression" (where judges consider who made more of an effort to finish the fight in that round) is a 
secondary criteria, followed by cage generalship and dictating the pace of the fight. The ABC also encourages its judges to score rounds 10-8 if a 
judge feels that one fighter has landed a substantial amount of "impactful" strikes or spent large amounts of time in dominant grappling positions, as 
"it is absolutely essential to the evolution of the sport and to demonstrate fairness to fighters" that rounds where a fighter controls much of the 
action are properly scored to reward that fighter.
</p>
</h3>
<h3>
<p>
At the end of the fight, each judge submits their total score for all rounds for each fighter, to determine the result by the following criteria.
</p>
</h3>
<h3>
<p>
Unanimous decision win: All three judges have the same fighter as the winner.
Majority decision win: Two judges have one fighter winning the fight and the third judge scores it a draw.
Split decision win: Two judges have one fighter winning the fight and the third judge has the other fighter winning it.
Unanimous draw: All three judges score it a draw.
Majority draw: Two judges score it a draw, and the third judge has a winner.
Split draw: One judge scores it a draw, and the other two judges have different winners.

<h3>
<p>
When a foul is charged, the referee in their discretion may deduct one or more points as a penalty. If a foul incapacitates a fighter,
 then the match may end in a disqualification if the foul was intentional, or a "no contest" if unintentional. If a foul causes a fighter to be unable 
to continue later in the bout, it ends with a technical decision win to the injured fighter if the injured fighter is ahead on points, otherwise it is
 a technical draw.
